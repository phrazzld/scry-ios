# SwiftLint Ruleset Review and Finalization

## Overview

This document summarizes the team review of the SwiftLint configuration and the changes made to finalize the initial ruleset for the Scry iOS project. The goal is to establish a baseline configuration that enforces our code quality standards while remaining practical for the current stage of the project.

## Changes Made to `.swiftlint.yml`

### 1. Temporarily Disabled Rules

Several rules have been temporarily disabled to allow for a more gradual adoption of stricter standards:

- `explicit_acl`: Currently many files don't specify access control levels explicitly
- `explicit_type_interface`: Several properties don't have explicit type interfaces
- `trailing_newline`: Multiple files are missing trailing newlines
- `trailing_whitespace`: Many files have trailing whitespace
- `multiple_closures_with_trailing_closure`: This conflicts with some SwiftUI idioms
- `file_header`: Disabled until we define a consistent file header template
- `trailing_comma`: Temporarily disabled for Package.swift compatibility

**Rationale**: Rather than failing the build immediately with numerous violations, we'll address these issues in a dedicated code cleanup task. This approach allows the team to continue development while gradually improving code quality.

### 2. Adjusted Rule Configurations

- **Line Length**: Error threshold increased from 160 to 180 characters
  - **Rationale**: SwiftUI previews and some generated code often exceed 160 characters
  
- **Identifier Name Exclusions**: Added common short variable names
  - Added: `to`, `x`, `y`, `i`, `j`
  - **Rationale**: These are common and clear in certain contexts (coordinates, loops)

### 3. Rule Removal

Removed the following rules from the opt-in list:
- `no_extension_access_modifier`: Conflicts with our use of `explicit_acl`

### 4. Maintained Rules

Critically important rules are maintained as errors:
- `force_unwrapping`: Continues to be an error (safety)
- `implicitly_unwrapped_optional`: Continues to be an error (safety)
- `no_print`: Custom rule maintained as an error (proper logging)

## Plan for Future Enhancement

1. **Code Cleanup Pass**: Schedule a dedicated task to address the violations of temporarily disabled rules, then re-enable them.

2. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct quarterly reviews of the SwiftLint configuration to:
   - Re-evaluate temporarily disabled rules
   - Consider enabling additional rules as the codebase matures
   - Adjust thresholds based on real-world experience

3. **Custom Rules**: Develop additional custom rules for Scry-specific patterns or requirements as they emerge.

## Conclusion

This revised configuration balances code quality enforcement with practical considerations for the current stage of the project. It maintains strict enforcement of critical rules while temporarily relaxing others to allow for a phased improvement of the codebase.

The configuration will evolve as the project matures, with the goal of gradually enabling more rules and increasing strictness over time.
